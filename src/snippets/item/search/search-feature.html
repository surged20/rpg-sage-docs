				Yup, we said it, you can ask RPG Sage to look something up on Archives of Nethys and get a list of links to the top 10 (or so) results!
				We can even render quite a bit of content directly in Discord for you so that you don't always have to click that link and leave your chat to get the content for yourself or your group!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note about content search.</strong>
				<br/>
				Currently, we can only search content on Archives of Nethys for Pathfinder 1e, Pathfinder 2e, and Starfinder ... but we are always looking for ways to search content for more games!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note about posting search results.</strong>
				<br/>
				Currently, we can only post some things from Pathfinder 2e, but we plan to continue expanding the amount of content we can post directly.
				When results are determined, if there is only one item that was returned for your search <strong><em>and</em></strong> the name is exactly what you searched for <strong><em>and</em></strong> we have the ability to post it directly, we will post it instead of returning a list of results.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note about "search" vs "find".</strong>
				<br/>
				By default, using <code>sage?magic missile</code> performs what we call "search"; it searches all the text of the content being searched. If you include an exclamation, for example <code>sage?!magic missile</code>, then RPG Sage will only consider the names of the items returned when it provides you with results.
				When results are determined, if there is one item that was returned for your search with a name that is exactly what you searched for <strong><em>and</em></strong> we have the ability to post it directly, we will post it instead of returning a list of results.
